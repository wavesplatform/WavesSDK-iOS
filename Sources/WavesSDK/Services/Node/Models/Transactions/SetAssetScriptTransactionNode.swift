     Set asset script transaction (set script to asset)

     You can only update script of asset, that was issued before by [IssueTransaction]

     An asset script is a script that is attached to an asset with a set asset script transaction.
     An asset with the attached script is called a smart asset.
     You can attach a script to an asset only during the creation of the asset.
     Script can be developed with [Waves Ride IDE]({https://ide.wavesplatform.com/)

     Smart assets are unique virtual currency tokens that may represent a tangible real-world asset,
     or a non-tangible ownership that can be purchased, sold, or exchanged as defined
     by the rules of a script on the Waves blockchain network.

     Only the issuer of that asset can change the asset's script.
